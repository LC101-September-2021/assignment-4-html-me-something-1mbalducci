               <h2>Déjà Vu:  Why I Am Going</h2>
               <p>
                  In the fall of 2022 I hope to be setting sail on my second adventure in France! This trip is a bucket list trip for me inspired by my last sojourn there in 2009.  Over ten years ago I lived and work in Paris for six months at an architecture firm as part of my degree program.  While I run my own <a href="http://www.michellemariephotographie.com/"> photography business in St.Louis </a> today, I am technically an architect and started out my career in architecture.  During my time in Paris I tried so hard to speak French but was at such a low level of language competence that it was not possible.  Most Parisians speak amazing French and would start speaking English the moment they heard me stumbling over my French words.  
                   <br>
                  Ever since I returned to the states, I have been studying french, but really got serious about my studies three years ago.  Now I hope to “redo” my seven month experience in France but this time as a French speaker who is able to fully immerse herself in the culture.  I would also loose my mind with joy if I met a friend that wanted me to visit from time to time after my stay.

                  You might think that I am pining to return to Paris, and you would be dead wrong. Paris is romantic and breathtaking, but my one goal of my trip is to improve my language skills.  Since most Parisains speak wonderful English and I am inherently lazy and slightly terrified of speaking French, I will not being going to any large cities. Instead I will be aiming to live and work in the central of France in a rural community were I stand the best odds at a full immersion experience.

               <p id="testP" class=funParagraph style="text-color:white;">
                  I debated a long long time about what I should do while I was in France for all those months! I considered getting a one year Masters Degree  (Public  University is FREE in France to all students both French and international). I also tossed around the idea of working as an apprentice under a photographer I admired.  But finally I decided on teaching English in France with the <a href="https://frenchhighereducation.org/teaching-assistant-program"> TAPIF program</a>.  The program combines all the elements I was looking for to structure my trip in France.  As a teaching assistant you are provided a work visa, are only required to work 12hrs a week, and you get 2 weeks paid vacation every 6 weeks since French schools take tons of vacations! With TAPIF  I will make enough money to pay for living expense and food while I’m there.  The rest of my income will come from passive income sources I have back in the States (it’s so nice to be an adult now and not a student!)
                  <br>
                  Another huge draw of the TAPIF program for me is how much free time I will have to fully immerse myself in all things French.  I hope to explore the city I live in, have a French roommate who hopefully wants to be my friend, taking a yoga class, and do some professional networking that will hopefully bring me back to France in the future.

               <h3></h3>
               <p>
                  Right now I am considering three cities to live in: Orléans, Tours, and Lyon. These cities are located in the center of France and have fewer english speakers. It is INCREDIBLY hard to be strict with myself about being in the center of France.  I’m very drawn to the French Mediterranean and would adore spending my time in any of their coastal beach cities.  But so would all other Americans so it’s a no-go. I will end up making my final decision on where I go based off of my wedding schedule for the spring of 2023.  There are three school zones in France and they each have different vacation schedules in the spring.  I will apply to be in the city that has a spring vacation in April that aligns with when I need to come home to photograph my weddings.
                  <br>
                  I am excited to be making one of my bucket list dreams come true: to become fluent in a second language:). Wish me luck!
